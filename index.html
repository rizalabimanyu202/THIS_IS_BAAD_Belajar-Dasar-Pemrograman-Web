                                <h2>「君が好きだと叫びたい」</h2>
                                <br/>君が好きだと叫びたい is BAAD's third single, released on Desember 1, 1993.
                                <br/>The title song was used as the opening theme for the first half of TV Asahi's anime series 『SLAM DUNK』 BAAD's biggest hit song.
                                <br/>The instrumental of this song was used in the next preview of the anime, and continued to be used even after it became the opening theme for the second half,『ぜったいに 誰も』.
                                <br/>According to Kyoji Yamada, the vocalist and lyricist, Takehiko Inoue, the original author of the manga 『SLAM DUNK』, offered to write the song with the image of "hotness" and "sweat," and the lyrics for the A and B verses were written immediately. However, while struggling with the C melody for the chorus, the director suggested, ``Why don't you put more lyrics into the melody at the beginning of the chorus and put the words directly on it?'' It is said that the word ``tai'' was born. In the chorus, "Let's change tomorrow", the live performance includes "Let's try scratching the morning glory," "Let's brush the sea lion's teeth," "Let's buy a soup roll," "Dan Ikeda and Keizo Kanie," Sometimes he sings songs with improvised lyrics, such as ``Let's take a bite of a pumpkin seed.''
                                <br/>On March 1, 2021, it was selected as the User Voting Award (1989-1999) in Sony Music Entertainment's anime song popularity voting campaign ``Heisei Anime Song Award.'' In the same year, Ayaka Sasaki (Momoiro Clover Z) covered it as a single.
